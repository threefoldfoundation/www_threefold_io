#### <span class="blue">$INCA | VERSION 4</span>


### **Catalyzing Expansion**


**In Q4, we will formally announce TF Grid 4.0 and its corresponding token $INCA.**
With version 4, ThreeFold aims to expand to 1+ million nodes in the coming years and $INCA is the token which will facilitate this growth. Its rewards are distributed for capacity usage (80% goes to farmers), capacity provisioning, and hosting solutions on the ThreeFold Cloud. This new tokenomics model is designed to incentivize rapid expansion and utilization of the network.

#### <span class="green_text">$TFT | VERSION 3</span>


### **Driving Innovation**


The ThreeFold Token ($TFT) serves as the token of our third generation. This token has been pivotal in driving ThreeFold’s initial phases, playing a crucial role in both the development of the technology and the grid’s initial rollout. There is a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens, which might be reached within six months. This milestone underscores the growth and adoption of the ThreeFold ecosystem, reflecting the project’s progress since its inception.

#### <span class="green_text">COMMON QUESTIONS</span>


## **Learn more about <span class="blue">our tokens</span>**


<br>


- #### What is $INCA?
    $INCA is the continuation of $TFT for TF Grid v4. A new tokenomics model and reward system allows us to scale out faster.


<br>


- #### How as a user can I use my $TFT and $INCA?
    TFT and INCA are both usable on both version of the ThreeFold Cloud.
    The INCA and TFT can be used to fund the INCA liquidity pool which allows conversion between USD, INCA and TFT.


<br>


- #### Will you support currencies like USD or EUR?
    In version 4 of the Cloud, users will be able to pay in TFT, INCA and fiat currencies like USD and EUR. The Liquidity pool will take care of the conversion between those currencies. Endusers will not have to understand the specifics of TFT or INCA if they don’t want to..


<br>


- #### How many tokens are there now?
    +-960 Million TFT have been farmed on TFGrid 3.x. We will stop farming once we hit 1 Billion. After the Billion TFT has been minted then all farming will be in $INCA. The exact tokenomics has not been defined yet, but we have multiple variations and are making simulators. We are working with tokenomics and DePIN experts to validate the possibilities.
