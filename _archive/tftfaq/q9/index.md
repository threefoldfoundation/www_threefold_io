title: What is the difference between staking and vesting?
---

In general, staking mechanisms offer additional rewards in exchange of holding some tokens. With the ThreeFold Grid 3.0 release, it is possible to stake your TFT by keeping them in your wallet. By doing so, you'll receive discounts on capacity reservation. You can find more information about staking  [here](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tfgrid/pricing/threefold__pricing?id=discount-levels).

The ThreeFold Connect App also provides a vesting option. Vesting is a voluntarily mechanism that allows community members to reduce the circulating supply by locking up their TFT. While it doesn't provide any personal benefits, it has a positive impact on the overall tokenomics.
