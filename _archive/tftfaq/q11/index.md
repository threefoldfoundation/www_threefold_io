Yes, the value of TFT is the same on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Stellar. You can find how to migrate between BSC and Stellar [here in the wiki](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tokens/threefold__tft_bsc_bridge). Note that the exchange price of TFT may vary on different exchanges according to market conditions.
