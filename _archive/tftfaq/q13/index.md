Important note: The ThreeFold Token (TFT) is not an investment instrument and it's value should not be based on speculation.  A TFT represents a unit of compute, storage and network capacity on the ThreeFold Grid and is backed by real hardware. You should buy TFT only if you believe in the future of the ThreeFold Grid.
