title: How and where can I buy TFT?

To buy TFT, users can go to regulated exchanges, DEXs (decentralized exchanges) and wallets or directly to ThreeFold's buy and sell platform. Like most digital currencies, TFT is transferable to any other compatible wallet.

The most used platforms are:

1. [Pancake Swap](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tokens/threefold__tft_binance_defi) to exchange any Binance Smart Chain token to TFT.

3. [Stellar DEX](https://www.manual.grid.tf/documentation/threefold_token/buy_sell_tft/tft_lobstr/tft_lobstr_short_guide.html) to exchange XLM or other stellar based tokens to TFT (multiple wallets and DEX UI supported).
