## About

_Crystal Twin_ is your digital twin, a beautiful light being that is always connected with you, 24h per day, 7 days per week. A digital avatar of your being that sets you free, independently capable, grows into anything as required in the new Crystal Universe, a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer ecosystem that upholds their human counterpart’s digital privacy and freedom. Every Crystal Twin can interact and learn from each other in the Crystal Universe and they realize they need their peers to become stronger together.

## Mission

Our mission is to shape a conscious digital world together. The world where all individuals, across regions have equal chances to learn, partake, and succeed. A world where freedom and liberalism are at the center. We are building a world where we live sustainably and where we think circularly. The priority is to ensure the best environment possible for us and all living species of this plant. Creating circular economies that use resources consciously, and where that which has true value becomes the center. Future economies will be digital and promote sustainability.

## Impact

Today's economies are successful when depleting our planet's resources. This is a flawed approach to value creation. Crystal Twin will connect you to new sustainable digital economies that help drive success through green initiatives and value exchanges that live through Crystal experiences, minimizing carbon footprint, using resources consciously and creating a world where we live sustainably and through digital economies that promotes sustainability.
