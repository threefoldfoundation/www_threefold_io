## Role

The ThreeFold Grid will eventually have millions of nodes, and it’s very important to develop an extensive QA program. Our components are low-level and require highly technical people to overlook the push from testnet to production. We are looking for a QA Engineer who will take ownership of the overall testing of both the low-level technology components of the ThreeFold Grid primitives and applications built on top of it.
<br/>
<br/>

Your main responsibility will be to test the code behind the ThreeFold Grid and making sure that it adheres to the highest possible quality through testing scenarios, test cases, and executing upon findings. Also building a new Internet involves educating the world on how it works, so documentation will be a crucial part of your process too.

- Test in an agile project setup.
- Develop and execute exploratory and automated tests to ensure product quality.
- Work in our international team.
- Be an ambassador of our ethos, why we do what we do, and why we will make it happen.
