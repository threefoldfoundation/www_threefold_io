        <p class="fade-in mt-6 text-lg lg:text-xl font-light text-gray-200">We are at the dawn of AI, a transformative force that will redefine how we live, work, and interact with technology. AI presents an incredible opportunity for humanity, however, as AI systems become more powerful, their control sits in the hands of a few corporations, raising serious concerns around privacy, bias, accessibility, and so on.
            <br>
            <br>
          Further, centralized cloud providers are bottlenecks, as AI compute demand is outpacing supply and training AI models is too expensive.
          <br>
          <br>
          We must not repeat mistakes of the past. Without decentralization, AI will remain controlled by a few corporationsâ€”limiting accessibility, innovation, and independence. To ensure AI benefits everyone, we must advocate for decentralized, open-source AI models that are transparent, ethical, and community-driven. And this can only happen on an infrastructure like ThreeFold.</p>
