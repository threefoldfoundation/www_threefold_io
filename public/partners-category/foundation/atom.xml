Enterprises building on top of Casper technology will be able to choose to run on ThreeFold’s peer-to-peer cloud for storage and compute resources. This enables them to achieve security and scalability far beyond what the centralized cloud providers can offer today.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
On a smaller scale, anyone will be able to contribute to Casper’s blockchain security, resiliency, scalability and decentralization, by deploying a Casper Validator node on the ThreeFold Grid in just a few clicks. The ThreeFold deployment mechanism removes all technical complexity of running Blockchain nodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ownCloud develops and provides open-source software for content collaboration, allowing teams to easily share and work on files seamlessly regardless of device or location. More than 200 million users worldwide already use ownCloud as an alternative to public clouds - and thereby opt for more digital sovereignty, security and data protection. For further information, please visit &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.owncloud.com&quot;&gt;www.owncloud.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or on Twitter &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ownCloud&quot;&gt;@ownCloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in the partnership is the launch of the ownCloud instance on the ThreeFold Grid – demoed live at ownCloud Conference 2021 in September – and the development of  a pilot program to bring an interested subset of the ownCloud audience over to the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term vision is a full range of file sync, file sharing and content collaboration solutions that combine the strengths of both technologies. ThreeFold and ownCloud are excited to develop complementary offerings that reflect their shared beliefs in open standards and digital sovereignty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to raise the bar of education by having experts to teach the students and by initiating teacher training with help of technology. For years we have been working to bring positive and needed change to the education system and this is another step forward. A peer-to-peer education system opens up the possibilities for learning and positive solutions for our world. Additionally we will be able to set up global projects to tackle climate change and other issues allowing students to connect, brainstorm, create, share, solve problems and take action.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Our vision is to provide a one stop full spectrum art education platform to access, learn and share knowledge in art and culture from across the globe for free. To date, we have compiled 40,000 pieces of art from all around the world into our database, and we aim to become the world’s largest art and cultural gallery, available to everyone, everywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#impact&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: impact&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Impact&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art can act as a catalyst to tap into our inner potential as well as our collective intelligence. When going through the history of humanity, it is clear that Art played a major role in shaping the most advanced civilizations of humankind, across eras. Art is a proven tool to inspire faith and elevate cultural growth, while bringing a new perspectives about our reality. Today, studies show that there is a positive correlation between schoolchildren’s grades in math and literacy, and their involvement with drama or music activities. Also, art brings people together and gives people a chance to be part of a community. Art influences society by changing opinions, instilling values and translating experiences across space and time. Research has shown art affects the fundamental sense of self. Therefore we believe that free global access to art and culture is a prerequisite for a development of human kind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
