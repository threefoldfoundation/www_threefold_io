# Threefold Website
Official website for Threefold.

**Administration & Access**

This website is administered by [ThreeFold's Web Admins](https://github.com/orgs/threefoldfoundation/teams/team_web_admin). Publishing changes directly to `development` and `master` branches requires access for repository admins. Please see [contribution procedures](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

**Deployment**
- Production: [www.threefold.io](https://www.threefold.io) (`master` branch)
- Staging: [www2.threefold.io](https://www2.threefold.io) (`development` branch)

## Getting started

1. Install `hero` if you don't have it

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeflowuniverse/crystallib/development/scripts/installer_hero.sh | bash
```

1. Clone repository

2. edit content or playbook

3. run playbook to preview website in browser

```bash
#is using branch development_zola
hero zola -u https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/www_threefold_io/tree/development_zola/playbook
#or in this repo, which does above
start.sh
```

4. save and publish changes

## Development

This website is built with `hero`, using `zola` under the hood. 

```bash
#push changes
hero git push -f www_threefold_io  -m 'some comment'
hero git push -f threefold_data  -m 'some comment'
```

Finally, start a browsable local copy of the site that will respond to changes in the source files like this:

Zola will display a local address such as `http://127.0.0.1:1111` which you can click or copy and paste into your browser to view the site on your own machine.

That's itâ€”have fun!
