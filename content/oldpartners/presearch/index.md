## About

[Presearch](https://presearch.org) is an open, decentralized search engine that rewards community members with Presearch Tokens for their usage, contribution to, and promotion of the platform. In a world where one company controls 77% of all searches, influencing trillions of dollars in spending, shaping perceptions and effectively acting as the primary gatekeeper to the Internet, a new, open and community-driven search engine is a necessity. Presearch has an innovative go-to-market strategy to target the most frequent searchers - web workers - and gain early adoption, on our way to releasing future versions of the open source platform that will utilize a blockchain-based index, curated by the community.

## Presearch and ThreeFold

Our joint mission is to further decentralize the infrastructure that powers the revolutionary search engine experience that Presearch has built, by empowering community members to leverage ThreeFold's P2P cloud and help distribute Presearch across geographical edges.
<br/>
<br/>
Presearch created a decentralized search engine that rewards node operators with PRE tokens when they run Presearch nodes. Through our collaboration, anyone is able to easily launch a Presearch node running on the ThreeFold decentralized peer-to-peer internet grid with no technical knowledge required.
