## About

[ODE](https://odeinfinity.com) is the first vertically integrated SaaS consumer data platform with a mission to change the world of consumer data privacy, lean data science and organic compliance. Built on blockchain and AI, ODE Infinity defines a new paradigm for digital engagement for enterprises. We are a passionate and ambitious team with the required balance of innovation, entrepreneurship and enterprise experience with Fortune 100 and successful exits. 
<br/>
<br/>
The current data supply chain is fragmented, archaic, and unethical and it is time for a new entrant to shape the future by disrupting it and dis-intermediating the data brokers to enable a direct and trusted relationship between enterprises and their digital consumers. We have built a significant demand across the world and are looking to launch our pilots later this year targeting 3 million users, and expect to achieve our financial targets ahead of schedule. 
<br/>
<br/>
We are excited about our journey and the traction we've achieved to date and are aligning with like-minded partners to effectuate an Open Data Economy that is both meaningful and rewarding.
