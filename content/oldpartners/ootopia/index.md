## Impact

We are heading towards a total global collapse whose consequences will undoubtedly crash the environment, the economy, and the social structures threatening our own speaces.
<br/>
<br/>

Effective actions are not being taken by global leaders, politicians or corporations.
<br/>
<br/>

For this reason, more and more people are afraid and eagerly looking for possible and accessible solutions at individual level.
<br/>
<br/>

Ootopia is one of these solutions.
