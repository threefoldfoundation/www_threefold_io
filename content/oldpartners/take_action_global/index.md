## About

Building on more than 60 years of classroom experience empowering students to be curious, ask questions, take action, and make a difference in their communities, we are bringing together like-minded educators seeking a different way of teaching and learning. The team at [TAG](http://www.takeactionglobal.org/) is committed to creating space for teachers and students to work at local and global levels for the betterment of humanity for today and for tomorrow.

## Impact

Through endeavors like the [Climate Action Project](https://www.climate-action.info/), our [Innovation Lab Schools](https://innovationlabschools.com/), and [Project Kakuma](https://www.projectkakuma.com/), we find ways to connect thousands of teachers with students around the world to provide free, quality, meaningful education.

We want to raise the bar of education by having experts to teach the students and by initiating teacher training with help of technology. For years we have been working to bring positive and needed change to the education system and this is another step forward. A peer-to-peer education system opens up the possibilities for learning and positive solutions for our world. Additionally we will be able to set up global projects to tackle climate change and other issues allowing students to connect, brainstorm, create, share, solve problems and take action.

## Powered by ThreeFold

Our peer-to-peer platform will run on the ThreeFold Grid and will utilize elements of Digital Twin technology. The Video Chat (Meet) solution will be used to allow teachers to teach refugees. We have already been doing this for five years with Project Kakuma, and thanks to the ThreeFold we will be able to allow people globally to connect and learn from peers, including refugees and others living in harsh conditions.

## Join saving our planet!

Every child deserves an education. Inspire change. Take action. Join us making the planet a better place by fighting polarization and giving everyone in the world a quality education.
