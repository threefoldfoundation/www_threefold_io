## About

We believe in a world where individuals and communities can have universal access to opportunities enabled by financial freedom and interconnected humanity.
<br/>

Lack of access to basic financial services & wealth creation opportunities have created a global poverty trap. Additionally, The World Bank estimates that up to 60 million people will likely fall below the International Poverty Line of $1.90 per day in 2020, as a result of the pandemic.
