title: Is there anything done for the ThreeFold Grid to be sustainable?
---

By starting from scratch on the operating system level, ThreeFold was able to eliminate a lot of complexity from the current web2 and web3 models to enable a super lighteight infrastructure. 
<br/>
<br/>
By doing so we are able to enable up-to 10x energy savings as compared to any other alternative on the market. Also with the future end-user solutions we are building, we should be able to host 20 digital lives for as much energy as a light bulb would consume. 
<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless being sustainable is not enough in times of climate change. It is important for all of us to find ways to not only minimize our carbon footprints but also find ways to regenerate the surface and marine ecosystems of our world. ThreeFold commits to offset the ThreeFold Grid 3x in the form of carbon credits to support regenerative projects all around the world.
