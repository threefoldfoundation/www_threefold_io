#### Step 1
### Host a Node

<br>

All you need to get started is a modern computer, electricity and network. Once booted with Zero OS, a computer becomes a ThreeFold Node.

#### Step 2
### Offer Capacity

<br>

The capacity of the node gets verified and registered in the ThreeFold Blockchain, securing access to a decentralized autonomous cloud for users and communities.
