## What is Farming?

ThreeFold Farming is a unique concept in the ThreeFold ecosystem where individuals (farmers) can:

<br>
 
- Deploy nodes (3Nodes) that connect to the ThreeFold Grid
- Contribute computing resources (data, cloud and network) to the decentralized ThreeFold Grid
- Earn rewards whenever your nodes provide capacity and are actively utilized on the grid.
- Support a peer-to-peer cloud infrastructure alternative to centralized providers

<div class="container max-w-7xl mx-auto">

## The Farming Process 

Anyone can become a ThreeFold Farmer by running nodes that contribute capacity to the grid. 

<br>

### **3NODES**

The ThreeFold Nodes are self-healing and autonomous. They provide data, network and cloud resources to the ThreeFold Platform, becoming active contributors to a decentralized digital infrastructure. 
While rewards are now based on actual usage, each node still delivers a powerful combination of modern technology and thoughtfully crafted design.

**A new bare metal operating system**
Zero-OS supports all required Web2 and Web3 workloads and allows millions of nodes to operate in full autonomous mode providing lower cost, better energy efficiency, more reliability and security.

<br>

**A Quantum Safe Storage System**
The Quantum Safe Storage System is capable of storing data indestructible, efficient, and ultra-scalable. Previous versions of this system are widely used to store Zetabytes of information by large organizations.

<br>

**A Quantum Safe Network System**
Mycelium can look for the shortest path, has a built-in naming & CDN (Content Delivery) system, can survive disaster and network cuts much more efficiently as is possible today.
