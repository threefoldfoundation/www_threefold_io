## **Empowering the Ecosystem**

<br>

For hosting the cloud, you earn tokens. For deploying solutions, you use them. Within ThreeFold, tokens are vital for facilitating peer-to-peer transactions between participants and catalyzing the growth of the ecosystem.

#### <span class="blue">$TFT | VERSION 3</span>

### **Driving Innovation**

The ThreeFold Token ($TFT) serves as the token for ThreeFold Cloud v3. This token has been pivotal in driving ThreeFold's initial phases, playing a crucial role in both the development of the technology and the grid's initial global rollout. There is a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens which might be reached in 6 months. This milestone underscores the growth and adoption of the ThreeFold ecosystem, reflecting the project's progress since its inception. 

|||

#### <span class="green_text">$INCA | VERSION 4</span>

### **Catalyzing Expansion**

ThreeFold aims to expand to 1 million nodes within 2 years, introducing $INCA as the new token to facilitate this growth. $INCA rewards are distributed for capacity usage (80% to farmers), capacity provision, and hosting solutions on the ThreeFold Cloud. This new tokenomics model is designed to incentivize rapid expansion and utilization of the network.

<span class="green_text">$INCA</span> and <span class="blue">$TFT</span> tokens can be used to buy capacity on either version of the grid.

#### <span class="green_text">COMMON QUESTIONS</span>

## **Learn more about <span class="blue">our tokens</span>**

<br>

- #### **Will you support currencies like USD or EUR?**
     In version 4 of the Cloud, users will be able to pay in TFT, INCA and fiat currencies like USD and EUR. The Liquidity pool will take care of the conversion between those currencies. Endusers will not have to understand the specifics of TFT or INCA if they donâ€™t want to

<br>

- #### **Why two tokens?**
     To rapidly achieve a million nodes, ThreeFold recognizes the importance of optimally rewarding both farmers and solution providers. The most efficient way to accomplish this is through upgraded tokenomics, requiring a new token.

<br>

- #### **How as a user can I use my $TFT and $INCA?**
     TFT and INCA are both usable on both version of the ThreeFold Cloud. The INCA and TFT can be used to fund the INCA liquidity pool which allows conversion between USD, INCA and TFT.

<br>

- #### **How many tokens are there now?**
     +-960 Million TFT have been farmed on TFGrid 3.x. We will stop farming once we hit 1 Billion. After the Billion TFT has been minted then all farming will be in $INCA. The exact tokenomics has not been defined yet, but we have multiple variations and are making simulators. We are working with tokenomics and DePIN experts to validate the possibilities.
