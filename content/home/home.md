# We are Building Web 4

Imagine a system built to scale to a planetary level, seamlessly compatible with AI, Cloud, Web2, Web3, and Edge IT workloads. A system that is resilient to unforeseen events, provides 100% uptime, and enables any machine and human to communicate over the shortest, most direct path possible.

That's **Threefold**

## A Global Community

With ThreeFold, individuals, organizations, communities, countries, and network states deploy their own sovereign infrastructure. The ThreeFold Grid has been live and operational since 2017.

Version 3.14 is live on Mainnet.

## ThreeFold is the Infrastructure Layer of Web 4 

ThreeFold is not a protocol. We’ve developed foundational technology that runs directly on bare metal (the hardware).

ThreeFold is likely the only active project with a truly scalable solution addressing the Internet and Cloud’s core components: Data, Cloud, and Network.

### Unbreakable Data

Data cannot be compromised and always remains private, owned by you. A scalable system, to the planetary level. Can be distributed and stored in ways which are at least 10x more efficient and orders of magnitude more secure and reliable.

### Autonomous Cloud

Self-healing and self-driving cloud based on an efficient and secure operating system runs directly on the hardware. Can run any Web 2, Web 3, or AI workload at the edge of the Internet, with more scalability and reliability.

### P2P Network

End-to-end encrypted overlay network, always looking for the shortest possible path between participants. Logical Internet address securely linked to a private key. Unlimited scale and performance optimizations.

## WEB 4: The Next Evolution of the Internet

Web 4 is the natural progression of the Internet, where humans and artificial intelligence work together to create a new paradigm designed to promote planetary well-being and ensure equal opportunities for all. Users are in 100% control of their data and no centralized services are needed.

Blockchain was the first step to Web3.

ThreeFold is the next step to Web4.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details open>
  <summary>Is this a separate new Internet?</summary>
  No, ThreeFold is a complementary Internet and works alongside the current Internet. It allows you to continue accessing and interacting with the current Internet while offering additional capabilities.
</details>
<hr />

<details>
  <summary>Why do we need a new internet?</summary>  
  The Internet has become fragile and overly centralized. Issues like authenticity, privacy, security, and sustainability necessitate a fundamental new approach to rebuild its foundation. 
</details>
<hr />

<details>
  <summary>This seems to big to be true. Is this real?</summary>
  For over 30 years, we’ve worked toward this vision. ThreeFold is the culmination of our journey, offering a fully operational product and a growing community of users, farmers, and partners. This is real and we are here to stay.
</details>
<hr />

<details>
  <summary>You have two tokens, TFT and INCA, why?</summary>
  TFT is our token which was used to build generation 1, 2 and 3 of the ThreeFold Grid of capacity. TFT is the reward for our loyal community. There can never be more than 1 billion TFT. We are now building generation 4 of the ThreeFold Grid of capacity and we need a new token to build this new generation. There will never be more than 3 billion INCA. Our partners will start selling new ThreeFold Nodes end Nov 2024 with a new reward scheme and ready to grow to millions of nodes.
