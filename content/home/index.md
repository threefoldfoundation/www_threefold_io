## A Co-Owned Global Sovereign **Internet**

ThreeFold is **a peer-to-peer open-source Internet platform that connects users directly with local Internet capacity** (storage, compute, and network) provided by farmers. A decentralized sovereign alternative to today's centralized Internet model.

<br>
<br>

## Internet **Reimagined**. Internet **Rebuilt**

Join a global community pioneering the decentralized, autonomous, and sustainable Internet. <br>
We empower individuals and communities to regain control of their digital lives and shape their own digital future.
