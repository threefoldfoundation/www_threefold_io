## **Self-Healing Data, Network, and Cloud Platform**

Imagine a system which can scale to a planetary level, is compatible with AI, Cloud, Web2, Web3 and Edge IT workloads, has the potential to recover from unforeseen events, provides 100% uptime, and allows any machine and human to communicate over the shortest, most direct path.

## **A ground-up approach**

ThreeFold is not a protocol. We've developed foundational technology that runs directly on bare metal (the hardware). ThreeFold is likely the only active project with a truly scalable solution addressing the Internet and Cloud's core bottlenecks: data, cloud, and network.

### **Unbreakable Data**

Data cannot be compromised and always remains private, owned by you. A scalable system, to the planetary level. Can be distributed and stored in ways which are at least 10x more efficient and orders of magnitude more secure and reliable.

### **Autonomous Cloud**

Self-healing and self-driving cloud based on an efficient and secure operating system runs directly on the hardware. Can run any Web 2, Web 3, or AI workload at the edge of the Internet, with more scalability and reliability.

### **P2P Network**

End-to-end encrypted overlay network, always looking for the shortest possible path between participants. Logical Internet address securely linked to a private key. Unlimited scale and performance optimizations.

<br>
<span class="text-md truncate ..." >
In January 2024, ThreeFold announced in collaboration with The ICT Commission of Tanzania and Holochain a collaboration to deploy sovereign Internet in Tanzania, along with the introduction of coding academies and innovation hubs. The Dunia Yetu cooperative is being set up and efforts will ramp up in 2025.

## **Ready for commercialization**

For years, ThreeFold has been quietly and steadily developing its innovative technology, with a solid foundation of mature infrastructure that is now ready to take the next leap forward.

<br>

We are currently fundraising for the next stage of our project – major commercial expansion. This will involve the launch of the $INCA token on the Solana blockchain. If you are interested in learning more or taking part, please reach out.
