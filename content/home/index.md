## A Co-Owned Global Sovereign **Internet**

ThreeFold is **a peer-to-peer open-source Internet platform that connects users directly with local Internet capacity** (storage, compute, and network) provided by farmers. A decentralized sovereign alternative to today's centralized Internet model.


<br>
<br>

## Internet **Reimagined**. Internet **Rebuilt**.

Join a global community pioneering the decentralized, autonomous, and sustainable Internet. <br>
We empower individuals and communities to regain control of their digital lives and shape their own digital future.

## Why __ThreeFold__

<br>

ThreeFold’s unique infrastructure can operate without centralized authority or server, empowering people and communities to build and store applications on a decentralized network owned and operated by its participants.  
<br>
ThreeFold is open-source, nobody owns or controls the ThreeFold Grid and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, ThreeFold fosters the security, trust and freedom that are often missing in today’s internet.
