ThreeFold empowers anyone to become a cloud service provider – no technical expertise required – allowing people and organizations to buy, sell, and use cloud resources autonomously and securely.

<br>

Together we are creating a cloud for everyone, owned by everyone.

<h3 class="font-semibold"><span class="blue">Project IN</span>ternet <span class="blue">CA</span>pacity:
<br>the fourth generation of the ThreeFold Grid</h3>



We’ve developed robust technology that enables anyone to become a cloud and internet service provider. Our secure autonomous system is capable of self-healing without human intervention, giving users complete control over where their data and applications are hosted.

<br>

**Project INternet CApacity** s the fourth generation of the grid, representing the culmination of years of work by ThreeFold.

<br>

This project serves as the foundational layer for AI, Web2, Web3, and DePIN projects. It allows everyone to host their applications on a decentralized cloud infrastructure, providing reliable, sovereign storage, network, and compute capacity.

<br>

**ThreeFold has been building decentralized physical infrastructure long before the term “DePIN” was coined.**

## **A <span class="blue">Decentralized</span> Future for Us All**

<br>

ThreeFold believes in open-source collaboration to empower human potential. 

Together, we create, host, and co-own the foundational layer of an upgraded internet.

<br>

Our technology operates close to the hardware, enabling most Web2, Web3, <br>and DePIN projects to run on top of the ThreeFold Decentralized Cloud.

<br>

**Our story is a collective story. Let’s write it together.**

![Image](sovereignty.png#small#mx-auto)

<br>

#### **Sovereignty**

Enables nations and individuals to control their Internet capacity, promoting digital independence through an autonomous cloud network.

|||

![Image](performance.png#small#mx-auto)

<br>

#### **Performance**

By processing data closer to users, it reduces latency and improves real-time responsiveness.
