The internet is evolving once again – but this time, not through the types of platforms or services that defined past waves. What we’re witnessing is the emergence of an **agentic internet**, where autonomous digital agents will become the foundation of online life.

</br>

This evolution could unfold in one of two directions:

- **Centralized**, where a handful of corporations and governments control the agents, their data, and the infrastructure they run on
- **Decentralized**, where individuals and communities own their agents, data, and digital environments, creating a more open, sovereign web.

</br>

At ThreeFold, we believe the decentralized path requires a new kind of digital foundation – one we call the **Sovereign Agentic Cloud**.

</br>

This is not just another version of the internet, it’s the necessary foundation for a decentralized digital ecosystem built for the future: a new generation of cloud and AI infrastructure that is faster, greener, and smarter.

</br>

Our roadmap to this future unfolds in three phases:

- The Cloud
- The Network
- The Agents

</br>

Each phase builds on the one before it, sequentially creating the architecture for a truly sovereign agentic cloud.

</br>

The **Cloud** lays the groundwork with decentralized compute and storage – the base layer of an independent digital life that expands as new capacity comes online across the grid.

</br>

But capacity alone means little without coordination. That’s where the **Network** comes in, connecting distributed nodes into an intelligent mesh where data, models, and services can move freely.

</br>

With computation and connectivity in place, the system becomes ready for cognition – the **Agents**. These self-owned AI agents emerge as the logical extension of the architecture, using the Cloud for processing and the Network for communication. Together, they form the first generation of decentralized, autonomous intelligence.

### **The Cloud**
The Cloud forms the foundation, a 100% Kubernetes-compatible compute and storage layer that operates as a global, distributed cloud.

</br>

Built on top of the ThreeFold Grid, it draws from independent capacity providers around the world. Each contributes compute, storage, and network resources, forming a resilient, peer-to-peer infrastructure that’s already live today.

</br>

This layer makes decentralized Kubernetes real and accessible. Developers can spin up clusters directly across the grid using familiar declarative workflows, autoscaling, monitoring, and logging tools – all without reliance on centralized cloud vendors.

</br>

The result is a production-grade environment that offers the usability of conventional clouds combined with the sovereignty, security, and resilience of decentralization. Developers gain the freedom to deploy applications anywhere, anytime, without gatekeepers.

</br>

While ThreeFold’s community-driven open-source cloud has been live for years, this new Kubernetes-based solution marks a major evolution: simplified, commercial-ready, and purpose-built to host the next generation of autonomous agents. It’s the necessary foundation for the sovereign agentic cloud.

<br/>

Stay tuned this month for the release of the Kubernetes Cloud.

### **The Network**
The next step extends this foundation into a living, intelligent network layer.

</br>

This step introduces a full suite of decentralized network services – including VPN, DNS, CDN, and LLM gateways – all designed to make the underlying grid fully reachable, programmable, and autonomous.

</br>

These gateways transform ordinary grid nodes into public-facing endpoints, solving one of the hardest problems in decentralized hosting: achieving global accessibility without dependence on scarce IPv4 addresses or centralized ISPs. 

</br>

Traffic moves dynamically across the mesh. Every connection is encrypted end-to-end. And instead of relying on fixed routes or central ISPs, the network forms a peer-to-peer overlay that automatically discovers and maintains the most efficient path between nodes. 

</br>

When a node or connection goes down, the network self-heals, rerouting traffic in real time to maintain uptime. This allows workloads running anywhere on the grid, even on devices without public IPs, to communicate securely and perform as if they were hosted in a single, unified data center. 

</br>

What sets this network apart is not just its autonomy, but its evolutionary behavior. As the grid grows, it adapts, reconfiguring routes, optimizing performance, and expanding reach.

</br>

Parts of the network are already operational, with ongoing developments making it ever more powerful, efficient, and resource-rich.

### **The Agents**
The final phase brings the architecture to life: the Agent Layer, the cognitive and operational tier of the Sovereign Agentic Cloud.

</br>

Within this layer, every person can have one or more Personal Agents – intelligent digital counterparts that manage tasks, workflows, and communication while maintaining full sovereignty over data and identity.

</br>

These personal agents can coordinate networks of "Worker Agents," each capable of handling specialized functions such as research, coding, analysis, or transactions.

</br>

Supporting them is a secure foundation of semantic search, private active memory, and long-term, zero-knowledge storage, allowing agents to learn, reason, and operate within encrypted, self-contained sandboxes. 

#### Agent Layer Evolution: From AGI to ACI
While much of the world is racing toward AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) – massive centralized systems aiming to replicate human cognition – we’re charting a different course.

</br>

Today’s AI giants control nearly all of the compute, data, and infrastructure required to train and deploy large models. This concentration of power brings enormous risks such as surveillance-driven data collection, bias embedded at scale, and energy consumption rivaling entire nations.

</br>

ThreeFold’s approach is rooted in Augmented Collective Intelligence (ACI). Not a machine trying to mimic humans, but a system that grows through shared human experience while protecting each individual’s privacy.

</br>

There’s no hidden monetization model, no surveillance layer, no opaque black box where your information disappears. Each agent learns locally, contributes globally, and respects the sovereignty of its user. It’s a model of intelligence that grows organically, not hierarchically.

### **Building The Vision**
That is the vision of what we call the Sovereign Agentic Cloud: a fully decentralized ecosystem where the Cloud provides resilient compute and storage, the Network connects nodes into an intelligent, self-healing mesh, and the Agent layer brings autonomous, personal intelligence to life. Together these layers form a self-sovereign foundation for the next generation of digital life.

</br>

Development toward this vision is well underway, with the Cloud and Network systems already live and evolving and agents coming in Q1 2026. Stay tuned via our [news channel](https://t.me/threefoldnews) and [chat](https://t.me/threefold) as the rollout unfolds.
