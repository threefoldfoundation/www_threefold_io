The centralization of today’s Internet raises a slew of challenges around privacy, security, and sustainability – creating some negative impact for people and our planet. Meanwhile, ThreeFold is leading a vital movement towards a decentralized IT infrastructure and ecosystem to enable a more open, secure, and sustainable digital future. Let’s break down the type of positive impact ThreeFold can have.

#### Autonomous Tech to Empower Individuals & Communities
ThreeFold’s technology is designed to run autonomously, without the need for experts to manage it. The [Zero-OS operating system](https://threefold.info/tech/tech/zos_innovation.html) directly interfaces with the hardware, automating complex tasks like server maintenance, security updates, and system management. This allows anyone to easily set up and run a cloud service, contributing to a global network of servers and nodes without requiring advanced technical skills.

<br/>

By automating these processes, ThreeFold opens the door for more people to participate, and benefit from access to the technology, empowering everyone to have a meaningful impact in the digital world. ThreeFold aims to build a digital world that’s open to everyone, regardless of location, background, or resources.

<br/>

This means people and communities can own and control their data, applications, and online identities without relying on centralized providers. By equipping communities with these tools, ThreeFold fosters inclusivity, privacy, and digital independence for all.

#### Solutions for Privacy and Security
In an era plagued by data breaches and privacy concerns that dominate headlines globally, ThreeFold stands out with a comprehensive approach to digital security that includes a [Quantum Safe Storage system](https://threefold.info/tech/tech/zstor_innovation.html) and [Mycelium](https://threefold.info/tech/tech/mycelium_inno.html), a peer-to-peer overlay network developed by our team. And inherently, ThreeFold ensures that your data remains yours and is untampered with by third parties.

<br/>

ThreeFold’s decentralized architecture uses innovative systems to keep data safe, routes it through the most direct and efficient paths, and keeps it out of the hands of centralized authorities and cyber threats. With ThreeFold, privacy is built into the very fabric of the technology, giving users true ownership and control over their data, free from the risks of traditional internet models.

#### Promoting Digital Sovereignty
ThreeFold isn’t just about empowering individuals; it’s about giving countries and communities the power to control their own internet. By providing a self-sustaining cloud network, ThreeFold enables nations to build, manage, and own their internet without relying on foreign companies. This independence is crucial in a world where controlling the internet means controlling information.

<br/>

Beyond digital sovereignty, local internet infrastructure drives job creation in tech, engineering, and support services, stimulating the economy. It attracts investment, fosters innovation, and helps develop local expertise, creating new opportunities in software development, cybersecurity, and data management. By keeping data and operations within their borders, countries can ensure greater privacy and security, strengthen their digital economy, and shape their future in a globally competitive landscape.

#### Cost Efficiency and Environmental Sustainability
ThreeFold’s decentralized system offers a smarter, more sustainable way to manage data, cutting costs and environmental impact. Unlike traditional networks that rely on expensive central systems, ThreeFold lets data flow directly between nodes using the quickest, most efficient routes. Its Quantum Safe storage system (Fungistor) reduces data overhead from the typical 400% down to just 20%, saving space and costs.

<br/>

With the farmerbot tool, nodes switch off when not needed and turn on only when required, managed automatically without the need for human operators or central administrators. This is all handled through smart contracts, which keep everything running smoothly and securely. ThreeFold’s peer-to-peer setup finds the fastest path for data and uses local resources, reducing the carbon footprint associated with big data centers. Depending on the use case, this approach can save up to 10 times the energy, showing how ThreeFold drives real impact in creating a greener, more cost-effective internet.

#### Enhancing Performance and Scalability
Traditional cloud services often struggle with speed and can't keep up with growing demands. ThreeFold changes this by bringing data processing closer to users, making everything faster and more responsive. With millions of nodes worldwide in the future, ThreeFold will power a faster and more scalable Internet but also ensure that everyone, regardless of location, has access to high-performance digital services.

#### Building a More Connected and Equitable Future
ThreeFold’s vision is to create a global network that democratizes computing power and storage, enabling a fair internet where users control their data. By working together, we can ensure that the internet is private, innovative, and fair for everyone.

<br/>

As ThreeFold continues to grow, with new projects like the fourth generation of the Grid—Project Internet Capacity—our goal is to change the digital world for the better. We’re already active in over 50 countries, yet there is a long way to go. Our journey will lead to millions of nodes and new levels of digital security, independence, and fairness.

#### Conclusion
ThreeFold is more than just a technology company; it’s a movement for a better Internet. ThreeFold is set to make a big difference in today’s world by empowering people, protecting privacy, and supporting independence. We invite you to join us on this journey—together, we can build a digital future that works for everyone.
