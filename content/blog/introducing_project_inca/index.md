ThreeFoldâ€™s journey over the past years has been one of deep, collaborative commitment, marked by significant technological advancements and milestones in building a new cloud infrastructure from the ground up, as well as the global expansion of the grid to its current state. Throughout this journey, we have learned, adapted, and evolved, leading us to a strong strategy for the next chapter and achieving our collective vision.

### **Meet Project Internet Capacity**

We are thrilled to introduce Project Internet Capacity (INCA), a promising new extension of our mission. Building on years of dedicated work by team and community, Project INCA is the fourth generation of the ThreeFold Grid and introduces the INCA token (more on that below). Project INCA aims to be a Layer 0 for the DePIN ecosystem.

<br/>

On [our most recent project update community call](https://youtu.be/tXELhKk9RYg?si=fyz4K7gFQ1yD1PLS), we were grateful to hear from Michael Wellesley-Wesley, the founder of [Green Edge](https://green-edge.net/en) and prominent farmer on the ThreeFold Grid since 2017-2018, who introduced Project INCA to the community.

<br/>

Project INCA is rooted in three major objectives:

<br/>

- **Growth:** Expanding the grid to a million nodes.
- **Reliability:** Achieving service levels that allow edge and AI workloads to run efficiently.
- **Community:** Establishing scalable community and communication systems for vast communities at both the farming and user levels.

### **Mission and Vision**

As an extension of ThreeFold, Project INCA promotes a decentralized, community-driven, and inclusive cloud network, providing secure, private, and autonomous access to computing resources for all. The technology ensures a resilient, censorship-resistant infrastructure that protects data integrity and privacy, fostering innovation, digital sovereignty, and a more equitable internet.

<br/>

The vision is to provide a cloud engine for a decentralized internet where users control their data and digital interactions. A global network of interconnected servers and nodes known as the grid, will democratize access to computing power and storage, forming the backbone of a new digital era of sovereignty, security, privacy, and inclusivity. The token supports a robust ecosystem, enabling the free exchange of internet capacity among cloud service providers, builders, and users on the grid.

### **What to look forward to with Project INCA?**

Project INCA introduces several exciting features for farmers and users alike. Farmers can now set their own competitive prices within certain limits, enhancing their ability to earn for hosting capacity and selling it in the marketplace. To attract serious users, the project ensures robust uptime and performance guarantees, competitive pricing, and an improved user interface for easy app deployment. A quality-based reward system will motivate farmers to provide reliable service, while the flexible earnings model makes farming more appealing. The most significant advancement is the Mycelium network, offering unbreakable connectivity and efficient routing, which is crucial for scalability.

### **The Team Behind INCA**

An experienced team has been put together for our DePIN launch. This team has a 
range of backgrounds and a collective understanding of how to bring forward the INCA token. We don't see INCA as a break from the past but simply a continuation of TFT in another form.

<br/> 

**The Team**

<br/>

- **George Oliver**: An expert in the DePIN space with a $50 million investment fund.
- **Nick Hawkes and Max Gold**: Partners under Gold Hawks, proficient in scaling tokens and deeply connected in the Solana community.
- **Quentin**: Formerly of OKEx, specializing in liquidity and marketing.
- **Rob Beeland**: Founder of DePIN Connect, with vast marketing and influencer connections.
- **Mariza**: A high-powered lawyer overseeing regulatory and legal aspects.
- **Theo Chapman**: Managing Director of Zonaris, coordinating the group.
- **Mike Wellesley-Wesley**: The founder of [Green Edge](https://green-edge.net/en) and a long-time member of the farming community.
- **Sabrina and Mik**:  Our vital connectors between the INCA and ThreeFold teams.

<br/>

This team is dedicated to delivering INCA as a successful extension of TFT alongside the launch of TF Grid 4.0.

### **The Launch on Solana**

A major focus is on the launch of the INCA token, most likely on the Solana blockchain, which is the most active and prominent blockchain for the DePIN ecosystem. The timing depends on securing sufficient funding for liquidity pools and market making, which is essential for a successful token launch.

### **The INCA Token**

Many questions have risen about the introduction of a new token. INCA should be seen as an extension of TFT. It will coexist with TFT, both convertible and usable across TF Grid 3 and TF Grid 4. The primary differences are:

<br/>

- **Higher Profile**: INCA will likely have a more prominent presence, especially on Solana.
- **Tokenomics**: INCA will support app development, marketing, and community growth grants.
- **Max Cap**: Both tokens share a four-billion max cap, with INCA providing an opportunity to double TFT holdings (one TFT converts to two INCA).

### **Benefits for TFT Holders**

For TFT holders, the benefits are clear:

<br/>

- **Swapping**: Each TFT converts to two INCA (during 2024), potentially increasing value significantly.
- **Market Presence**: INCA's launch in the DePIN sector on Solana positions it in a visible and attractive market.
- **Limited Supply**: The initial supply of INCA will be limited, likely driving demand and price up.

<br/>

In conclusion, while INCA represents a new chapter, it is really a continuation and amplification of the ThreeFold journey. We anticipate exciting developments as we prepare for the TF Grid 4.0 launch and the introduction of INCA. We are happy to address any questions you may have on [our forum](https://forum.threefold.io) or [our main chat](https://t.me/threefold), keeping in mind that we are still refining many aspects of this project.
