## The Layer-0 for **Decentralization**

Any current or future technology, including blockchain, metaverses and web 3.0, can be hosted natively on the ThreeFold Grid via smart contracts with minimum migration. The grid is compatible with most open source tools and protocols.

## Scaled by the People <br> **to the Edge**

The ThreeFold Grid is formed by Farmers, independent people who connect 3Nodes (decentralized Internet capacity) anywhere electricity and network are present. Together, they form a globally distributed Internet infrastructure and earn income in the form of TFT.
