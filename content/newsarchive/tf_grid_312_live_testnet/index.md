We are pleased to share that TF Grid 3.12 is now live on Testnet. The team is now verifying the upgrade, all is passing fine.

<br/>

After a period of testing, we will create a proposal on bringing the new version live on Mainnet. To expedite this process and add more voices, we encourage the community to get involved in testing v3.12 and sharing your feedback in our [user / testing group](https://t.me/threefoldtesting).
