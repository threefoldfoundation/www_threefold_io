During our project update call, we covered three key topics: demos, Project Internet Capacity, and grid operations.

<br>

Scott presented two July demos—[deploying NextCloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhoY0yLIm3w) on ThreeFold’s decentralized grid and using [TFROBOT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDGnEQh5SsU) to deploy 100 virtual machines in just over three minutes. Timur also showcased Juggler, an open-source CI/CD tool.

<br>

Kristof then updated us on Project Internet Capacity, including its fourth-generation launch, potential tokenomics, and fundraising strategies. He also sought community feedback on whether to prioritize fundraising or launch in parallel.

<br>

Lastly, we discussed grid development, operational issues, and ways to protect farmers and maintain grid stability.
