In April's general project update, we shared about tech updates, validators/guardians, Mycelium (our end-to-end encrypted IPv6 overlay network), a "block" concept to improve how cloud capacity is offered and rented, grants, TF Grid 4 (our commercial DePIN launch), updates on partners, and an update on biz dev/on the ground activities.
