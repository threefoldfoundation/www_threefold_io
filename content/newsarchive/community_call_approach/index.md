After much thought and input from members of the community, we've decided to introduce a new format for community calls â€“ a streamlined approach while continuing to deliver value for the community: 

<br/>

**Community Calls**: Two demo sessions per month, with additional topic-specific calls and Q&As when possible and relevant.

<br/>

**Project Updates**: Quarterly, with the next one in December.

<br/>

Take a look at the full update and feel free to share your feedback on call timings [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/updating-our-approach-for-community-calls/4408)

<br/>

And as a reminder, [subscribe](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-events-calendar/4331) to the ThreeFold Events Calendar to have calls automatically added to your calendar of choice. We look forward to seeing you there!

<br/>

*Thank you for being part of our community!*
