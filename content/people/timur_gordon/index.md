I'm a software developer who loves nature and believes in using tech to help the planet and people. My background is in computer science, but I've also dabbled in math, philosophy, and cybersecurity. I'm really into open source because I think working together and sharing ideas is the way to go. When I'm not coding, I like to get outside and enjoy the outdoors. I'm here to do my bit, combining my interests and skills to make a difference with tech.
