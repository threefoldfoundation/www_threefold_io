Growing up in a multicultural environment has made me an enthusiastic and very open-minded person. Iâ€™ve had the incredible opportunity to live and travel in many countries, experiencing diverse cultures and backgrounds. Driven by a natural curiosity for new knowledge, my journey led me to discover ThreeFold and explore its innovative technology as part of my MSc thesis. ThreeFold's mission and values are perfectly aligned with my vision of a better future for all. I firmly believe that by leveraging technology, we can create positive change and foster a more equitable world.
