Mr. Obeidat is a global serial entrepreneur, researcher, and an impactful investor. He has over a decade of experience in leading successful technology startups, business consulting and fintech. In 2013, Obeidat built the first online investment platform for spot precious metals deliverable contracts, and was involved, as of 2016, in the investment of over a US$ billion in the gold markets in the EMEA. In 2017, he founded Investifai, an artificial intelligence (AI) powered wealth management startup, producing higher risk-adjusted returns than most of the traditional investment managers. Obeidat holds a BA degree in applied chemistry from Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), and a masters’ degree in global management (MGM) from Royal Roads University in Victoria, BC, Canada, where he conducted an empirical research that focuses on managing global multi-asset investment portfolios using machine learning models.
