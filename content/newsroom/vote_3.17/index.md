We are ready to start the release process for TF Grid 3.17 on Mainnet! Many thanks to the team who worked on this grid version and to those who participated in a successful testing period.

<br/>

3.17 brings updates to ZOS, ZOS Light, Mycelium, TF Connect, the dashboard, documentation, plus the introduction of the TF Chain Explorer, and more. Find full details [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tf-grid-mainnet-release-3-17/4597).

<br/>

For this to pass, we’re calling upon farmers to vote before Monday, June 02 2025 at 10am CEST either via [the dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/#/) or the TF Connect app under ‘DAO’.
