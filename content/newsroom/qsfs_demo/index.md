In this demo, Scott shows how to deploy ThreeFold's Quantum Safe Filesystem (QSFS) with the new Pulumi-based deployer. The deployer is a new feature in TF Grid 3.17, along with a new way of visualizing data with Grafana, and improved documentation. While it still takes some technical know-how, soon it will be easier than ever before to take advantage of Quantum Safe Storage!
