Peppermint is an open-source visualizer for ThreeFold minting receipts created by Scott using FastHTML. It was designed to help farmers quickly and easily check their TF nodes' farming rewards and provide clarity. The tool presents minting data in a user-friendly interface, provides detailed views of individual receipts, has sorting and filtering options, offers CSV downloads of uptime events, and more.
