In the recent community call, several inquiries from both the forum and chat remained unaddressed. So, we've compiled responses to these outstanding questions:

<br/>

***What does commercialization mean to the average farmer and how can they have a deeper involvement? How can we get 3nodes faster here in the US?***

*Commercialization means that there will be much more utilization, and this will lead to more rewards. This means that farmers will also need to meet certain standards related to reliability for commercial-level workloads.*

*Regarding getting 3Nodes faster in the US, for now, we recommend reaching out to existing vendors on this topic. Anyone can apply to become a vendor and ship in the US, and we expect that, as the project grows, more vendors will come on board.*

</br>

***Note***: We still need to discuss how the certified node program might change in v4.

</br>

***Can you guarantee that there will never be more than 1B Tokens in the future or can your opinion change later?***

*We can guarantee that there will never be more than 1B TFT on the Stellar Blockchain.*

</br>

***We shall move to the new Farmerbot, but it is still possible to run the old one, right?***

*You can run the old Farmerbot, but our recommendation is to update at the earliest as there have been a lot of new features that you wouldnâ€™t see in the old one. Most importantly the old Farmerbot did have a few bugs that were fixed in the new version. So please update as soon as possible.*
