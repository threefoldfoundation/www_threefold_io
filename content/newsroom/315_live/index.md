We are pleased to announce that ThreeFold's mainnet has now been upgraded to version 3.15. A few notes:

- Farmers using farmerbot may now safely [update and restart](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfgrid-3-15-release-farmerbot/4433) their farmerbot
- TF Connect app update is pending app store review (we will share when approved)
- We are still investigating an ongoing issue affecting uptime reporting (more to come)

<br/>

As a reminder, here are the [new features and improvements](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-grid-3-15-release-updates/4426) as part of this new grid version. And a major thank you to all those involved in building and migrating this release! Stay tuned for news on TF Grid 3.16!
