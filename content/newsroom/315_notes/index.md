Our development team is hard at work on version 3.15 of the ThreeFold Grid. Some key highlights are: 

<br/>

**50% Utilization Rewards for Farmers** : Following a previous GEP vote, 50% utilization rewards will be implemented for farmers hosting workloads on their nodes. Farmers will receive 50% of the spending on these workloads directly in their TFChain account during billing.

<br/>

**Mycelium 0.5: Unlocking Network Potential**: Mycelium 0.5 will launch with the 3.15 release, enhancing network redundancy and supporting up to 10,000 users. Available on Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS, and Android.

<br/>

**Grid Stack Evolution**: The 3.15 release will introduce independent grid stacks running on bare metal with Docker, enhancing resiliency and UX while providing a more flexible infrastructure.

<br/>

**Network Security and Rules**: Security remains a top priority. The team is addressing key security issues and developing clear cybersecurity rules focused on accountability, authentication, and transparency.
