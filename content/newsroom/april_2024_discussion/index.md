Thank you to those who joined us live for yesterday's community conversation. For those who missed it, the recording is now [live](https://forum.threefold.io/t/april-2024-community-discussion-recording/4303). Please note feedback for TF Grid 3.14 is still appreciated. You can find relevant links inside.

<br/>

In the coming weeks, we will have more community conversations where we discuss how to implement feedback from the community for either 3.14, 3.15, or 4.0 releases of the TF Grid.
