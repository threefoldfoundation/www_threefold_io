This document outlines proposed changes to the ThreeFold Grid and the utilization of its token (TFT), and introduces a new liquidity framework designed to create sustainable value for all participants.

<br/>

What's inside: implementation status and roadmap, dual token system, node economics and pricing, marketplace mechanics, and more.

</br>

*We acknowledge there are still important decisions to be made and gaps to fill.*

</br>

What happens next: community review, refinement, community call (to be announced asap), and finalization and implementation.
