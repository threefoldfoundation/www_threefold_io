Mik and Scott are back this month with a demo! You can find all of our previously recorded demos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTGQlepPqwUUhbtKZW2okEszK3AkDgC4Y).

### **Thursday, 15th May 2025: Private Networking with IPv6 and WireGuard**

This demo will present an alternative way of using [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) with ThreeFold Virtual Machines to achieve private network connections between groups of VMs. This method provides a flexible way to create stable and direct connections between VMs, which can be useful for creating clusters or high availability setups.

<br/>

The demo session will be held at 7 pm CEST / 1 pm EDT at [this link](https://bit.ly/tfcommunitycall).

See you there!
