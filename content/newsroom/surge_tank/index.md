Last Thursday, ThreeFold co-founder Florian Fournier joined SURGE TANK by [Surgence Labs](https://www.surgence.io/), as they explored the topic of DePIN. He was joined by Rykz and Vinh from Surgence along with L√©onie, co-founder of [Kaisar Network](https://kaisar.io/), and KaizerGaming88, head of biz dev at [Aethir](https://aethir.com/). (Full broadcast link at the bottom.)
