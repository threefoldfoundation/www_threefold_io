Scott and Mik are back with some demos this month featuring two of our flagship technologies: Quantum Storage and Mycelium.

<br/>

**Tue September 16: Quantum Storage & Quantumd** <br/>
Scott demos quantumd, a new management utility for ThreeFoldâ€™s Quantum Safe Filesystem. See how QSFS is easier to deploy and more robust than ever before!

<br/>

**Tue September 23: ThreeFold IPv4 Gateway for Mycelium & WireGuard Networks** <br/>
In this demo (designed in response to community feedback), Mik provides step-by-step guidance on deploying an IPv4 gateway on the ThreeFold Grid, using open source tools such as Ansible and OpenTofu. The solution enables users to expose applications and data running on internal virtual machines (nodes without public IPv4 addresses) to the public internet.

<br/>

Both calls will take place at 7pm CEST / 1pm EDT. Find the full details [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/september-2025-demos-discussions/4636).
