For those in Tanzania, we're excited to be partnering with H.E.R. DAO to run a developer meetup next week in Dar Es Salaam. The event will include demos of how to add capacity to and deploy on top of a sovereign internet infrastructure, the ThreeFold Grid.

As well, we'll be hearing from Tracey Bowen, Founder of H.E.R. DAO., and exploring the beginnings of a Dar-based Dunia Yetu Coding Academy.
