At ETHDenver 2025, Melena from [Genzio Media](https://www.genzio.co/) sat down with ThreeFold co-founder Florian Fournier to explore how ThreeFold is rebuilding the internet from the ground up.

<br/>

The conversation was simple, clear, and resonated with anyone who’s ever felt the internet just isn’t working the way it should. When asked, “What is ThreeFold and why does it matter to everyday people?”, Florian gave a super relatable analogy:

> “If you think of energy, having one country produce it for another makes no sense–yet that’s exactly how the internet works.”

<br/>

This is what we are trying to solve. Florian went deeper, explaining that the only way to fix this imbalance is to rethink the internet from the ground up, starting with its physical infrastructure. While many projects focus on protocols or layers built on top of today’s internet, we’re focused on something more foundational: enabling people everywhere to run the internet themselves.
