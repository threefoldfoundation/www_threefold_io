## ThreeFold and the Government of Zanzibar Partner to Launch the World’s First Fully Automated Digital Free Zone

February 26, 2025 – Zanzibar is set to become the world’s first fully automated Special Digital Economic Zone (SEZ) powered by ThreeFold. This groundbreaking initiative is a public-private partnership between the Government of Zanzibar and ThreeFold, the pioneer behind the world’s first fully decentralized AI, compute and storage network, fueling the new agentic, geo-aware Internet of the 21st century.

The ZAZ or Zanzibar Autonomous Zone will allow millions of people to get a secure, autonomous, and legally innovative environment for businesses, looking to operate globally as well as safeguard their digital assets. As geopolitical tensions and cyber threats continue to rise, the combination of a robust legal framework and a decentralized, censorship-resistant Internet presents a critical alternative for those seeking digital and operational autonomy.

“We are delighted to announce this landmark partnership with the Government of Zanzibar. Our agentic design allows for high scalability, and the in-built geo-awareness should be a requirement for any nation that is serious about its sovereignty. This initiative represents a major milestone for the tech community, offering a fully decentralized and legally protected environment where the ThreeFold Grid can be utilized to its full potential. It’s a game-changer for digital sovereignty,” said Kristof De Spiegeleer, Co-Founder of ThreeFold.
