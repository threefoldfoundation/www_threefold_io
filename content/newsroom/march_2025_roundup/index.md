March (and the first days of April) was packed with progress ‚Äì from exciting updates to the ThreeFold Grid to coverage by EV3 and the announcement of the DePIN summit to new demos and community discussions. Let‚Äôs look at the highlights!

### **TF Grid 3.16 Live on Mainnet!**

Thanks to our developers and grid testers for their efforts on building version 3.16 of the ThreeFold Grid. Earlier in the month, we created a Grid Enhancement Proposal to bring 3.16 to mainnet, which passed after a positive vote. Thanks to all those who took part ‚Äì you are the backbone of our community!

<br/>

Last week, the team began the process of migrating 3.16 to mainnet. During the migration they identified a small issue which was fixed, and we‚Äôre happy to share that version 3.16 is now live on mainnet! ‚úÖ Some of the highlights of this release include:

<br/>

- A new stability update for Zero OS (ZOS)
- The first prerelease of ZOS Light, making it easier to deploy ZOS on cloud providers like Hetzner and OVH by improving network compatibility.
- A Grid-Proxy update, improving how nodes and their hardware details are tracked
- Several updates to the TF Connect app: initial support for v4, a bridge to Solana, and more!

<br/>

Take a look at [this post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/gep-tf-grid-mainnet-release-3-16/4526) for more details, and thanks again to all involved in bringing this release live! Stay tuned for more on TF Grid 3.17 and other upcoming activities (check our looking ahead section at the end of this post).

### **Escape Velocity (EV3) Reports on ThreeFold**

[Escape Velocity](https://ev3.xyz/) üöÄ(EV3) has been doing research in the DePIN space about what true digital autonomy is and has shared their findings. Recently, they released a report entitled ‚ÄòThreeFold: Rearchitecting the Internet.‚Äù The report covered several themes including:

<br/>

- The vulnerability of global dependence, particularly as it relates to the Internet
- Challenges with TCP/IP
- Centralization of Internet control and why decentralization is key
- How ThreeFold offers a groundbreaking solution

<br/>

We‚Äôre proud of what we have built ‚Äì and are building towards ‚Äì and we‚Äôre pleased EV3 took the time to report on it. You can find the full coverage [here](https://paragraph.xyz/@ev3news/threefold-rearchitecting-the-internet).

### **We‚Äôre Co-Hosting This Year‚Äôs DePIN Summit**

We‚Äôre thrilled to be co-hosting DePIN Summit 2025 this July alongside EV3 and [Share](https://www.share.inc/)! Together we‚Äôre bringing the pioneers of decentralized infrastructure to East Africa üåç to discuss and collaborate alongside local industry and government leaders. Initial speakers include ThreeFold‚Äôs own Kristof De Spiegeleer and Florian Fournier, Sal Gala from EV3, Jose Aycart from Share, Neil Chatterjee from [Dawn](https://www.dawninternet.com/), and Raullen Chai from [IoTeX](https://iotex.io/)!

<br/>

Find all the details [here](http://www.depinsummit.xyz/).

### **V4 Nodes Have Started to Ship!**

As reported [last month](https://forum.threefold.io/t/unfolding-threefold-february-2025-roundup-03-03-update/4514), Zero OS 4 Development version has come alive, and v4 nodes have started to ship.

<br/>

If you haven‚Äôt already, you can order a v4 3Node from either [DuckFarmData](https://duckfarmdata.com/) (Americas) or [YourData Network](https://yourdata.network/) (Rest of World) and take part in the expansion of the fourth generation of ThreeFold.

### **Community Discussions & Feedback**

We opened up a [forum post](https://bit.ly/3DJNDFb) to gather feedback from farmers and grid users on how to improve the grid experience. This resulted in tremendous input from the community. ü§ù Key themes were identified around usability and accessibility, economic sustainability, technical enhancements, growth and adoption strategies, feature requests, and community and trust building.

<br/>

The results have now been [consolidated and synthesized](https://forum.threefold.io/t/seeking-your-feedback-to-improve-the-threefold-grid/4523/9) and shared within the ThreeFold team for future implementation. Thanks to all those who shared their thoughts.

<br/>

### **Demo Time: Mycelium and AIBox**

Check out our latest demos showcasing the power of Mycelium üåê, our end-to-end encrypted IPv6 overlay network, and get a sneak peek at the upcoming AIBox üß† ‚Äì a personal AI machine built for enthusiasts, developers, and researchers.

<br/>

In the [Mycelium demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oq15lxvkts), Scott and Mik walk you through how to set up the network, connect to applications, and deploy your own private, secure instance of Open WebUI on the ThreeFold Grid.

<br/>

Then, watch the [AIBox teaser](https://youtu.be/5JW5z_gi2qM?si=7cj9y-Ho7ESu3Z3X) to see how seamlessly you‚Äôll be able to use an AIBox using Mycelium for secure, private AI exploration. Both demos include timestamps for easy navigation ‚Äì and we‚Äôd love to hear your feedback or questions!

<br/>

This month, we‚Äôll host demos on Quantum Safe Filesystem and Kubernetes. Dates and times will be announced across platforms.

### **Looking Ahead**

The team is getting to work on TF Grid 3.17 and the features of that release will be communicated as soon as possible. This month you can also expect some more demos from Scott and Mik, as shared above! We‚Äôll also share more on the DePIN Summit as new speakers and details are announced. Stay tuned via our [news channel](https://t.me/threefoldnews) as things unfold. üîÆ
