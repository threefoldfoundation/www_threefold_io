We hope you‚Äôve had a fantastic start to the year. üéâ Here‚Äôs a breakdown of happenings from around the ecosystem over the past month.

### **TF Grid Operational Updates**

There has been major progress on TF Grid 3.16. Some of the key highlights of the release include:

<br/>

- Stabilization of Mycelium üåê
- Support of ZOS light integration within the dashboard üõ†
- Automation for deploying ZOS on cloud providers like Hetzner üí°

<br/>

This latest feature brings another flexible way of expanding ThreeFold capacity. We‚Äôll share more on this upcoming grid version as it heads towards release.

<br/>

Additionally, the team is working on Zero-OS V4 and the overall V4 infrastructure. This includes working on a V4 bootstrap image generator, as well as a V4 Flist image Hub and a V4 node registrar tool.

<br/>

There were two Grid Enhancement Proposals last month ‚Äì one on [adjusting the minting code](https://forum.threefold.io/t/gep-adjusting-minting-code-regarding-carbon-offset/4477) regarding a pool of tokens reserved for a carbon offset initiative (this vote passed) and one on [token-based voting](https://forum.threefold.io/t/gep-token-based-voting/4479) (this vote was rejected). Thanks for the conversation on these topics and to all who voted ‚Äì your participation is essential and appreciated in this decentralized movement.

### **Web4 Roadmap**

In December, we announced the Web4 components: V4 3Node, 3Phone (+ 3Bot), and 3Router.

<br/>

The initial [V4 3Nodes](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3node/) are currently being sold by two vendors from the community ‚Äì YourData Network and Duck Farm Data! ü§ù The development team is actively working on v4 infrastructure and one of our primary goals for 2025 is to expand the v4 grid ‚Äì substantially . We‚Äôre building a node sale campaign üåè as we speak and this will ramp up in the coming months.

<br/>

[3Phones](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3phone) come with built-in decentralized apps and seamlessly integrate with the ThreeFold Grid. The team expects a Q2 release for the 3Phone.

<br/>

We are super excited for the [3Router](https://docs.threefold.io/docs/components/3router/)! Powered by our Mycelium technology, these routers will form the backbone of a truly decentralized network and have the potential to enable seamless, secure communication between every person and machine on the planet. ü§Ø We will be sharing more info as we have it ‚Äì and we expect to begin production and delivery once 10,000 units have been pre-ordered.

### **Testing LLMs on the ThreeFold Grid**

The age of AI is upon us and we are firm believers that decentralized infrastructure is needed in order to bring forward this era in a responsible way. With an infrastructure layer like ThreeFold, AI LLMs can be autonomous and geographically aware, while empowering individuals and communities to oversee their development and use. The cost to provision becomes much lower, performance can be much higher. üí° And then there are the obvious privacy and security benefits provided by a decentralized infrastructure.

<br/>

The team is looking into efficient ways to run LLM models on the grid. We are currently exploring hardware combinations to optimize LLM workloads. Current tests involve a dual RX 7900 XTX layout, which consist of two small GPUs running in parallel. The tests are impressive so far and we look forward to demonstrating these capabilities to the community in the near future.

<br/>

An advantage to consider: the grid uses deterministic deployment and users know exactly which LLM model they are using and where the workload is being hosted. We call this geo-aware AI deployment. From our perspective, this gives an interesting edge to AI deployments on the grid.

### **On the Ground**

Some of the team including CEO Kristof De Spiegeleer and co-founder Florian Fournier were present at Davos in Switzerland to speak about ThreeFold. Kristof and Florian both spoke at the Africa House Future Forum üåç ‚Äì Kristof about how data and technology can enable a leapfrog model for Africa, and Florian on a panel about Web3, AI, and Blockchain technologies with a focus on innovative strategies for financial inclusion.

### **Looking Ahead**

We‚Äôre gearing up for evolution and expansion ‚Äì fine-tuning version 3 of the grid, building version 4, planning a node sale campaign, and looking forward to demonstrating the grid's capabilities around AI and LLMs.

<br/>

As we push forward, your participation is more important than ever. Whether you‚Äôre a farmer, a developer, a community advocate, or just someone passionate about decentralization, there‚Äôs a place for you in the ThreeFold movement. More to come.
