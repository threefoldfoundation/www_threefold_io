Yesterday, some of the team and friends of the project visited IIT Madras Zanzibar Campus to meet and explore possibilities of collaboration. For those not familiar, IIT Madras is globally recognized and one of the top/prestigious technical institutes in India and they have recently opened a campus here in Zanzibar.

Afterward, at [Zanzalu](https://zanzalu.super.site/), ThreeFold co-founder Kristof spoke alongside Matthew Schutte of Holochain on public goods and how to build a new application layer on top of a sovereign infrastructure co-owned by us all. Zanzalu is a spin-off of Zuzalu, the two-month pop-up city founded by Vitalik Buterin held in Montenegro last year.
