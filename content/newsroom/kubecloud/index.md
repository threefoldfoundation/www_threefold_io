In last week’s Summer/Winter 2025 Roundup, we shared a bit about KubeCloud:

<br/>

*The team has been working on a simple but powerful platform to provision Kubernetes clusters with low friction of onboarding to the ThreeFold Grid. A catalog / directory view makes it easy for users to find what they need and credit card payments make it easy to get started.*

<br/>

*Kubernetes delivers standard, cloud-native deployment models, empowering developers and DevOps engineers to deploy resilient, scalable workloads using familiar tools, while maintaining sovereignty over compute, storage, and networking.*

<br/>

*The main features requested have been completed and the team is in testing mode.*

<br/>

The introduction of KubeCloud is part of the greater ongoing commercialization of the grid, which is one of the highest priorities of the team at the moment. This includes the developments of the ThreeFold Marketplace and HERO and necessary improvements to the flagship Mycelium and Quantum Safe Storage offerings. Additionally, the team is pursuing several commercial collaborations around utilization and grid expansion and looking into integrating new hardware models capable of handling serious next-generation / AI workloads.

### **What KubeCloud Means for Users**

While users have long been able to deploy Kubernetes clusters on ThreeFold, KubeCloud makes it possible for people to deploy modern, containerized workloads without the steep learning curve typically associated with setting up clusters.

<br/>

Here’s what users can expect right out of the box:

<br/>

- Deploy clusters in one-click
- Discover what’s available via the integrated catalog / directory view
- Pay seamlessly with credit cards (shown below)
- Use familiar Cloud-native tools
- Retain full sovereignty & control
- Leverage enterprise-grade security
- Scale workloads flexibly based on demand
- Monitor clusters in real-time
- Collaborate seamlessly with your team(s)

<br/>

To go deeper on some of the key advantages of the solution:

<br/>

- **Integration with Mycelium** provides ultra-fast end-to-end encrypted decentralized networking inspired by nature, forming a resilient, adaptive mesh that routes around failures and optimizes for speed and security.
- **Simple web gateway access** exposes any service to the public web with a simple Kubernetes resource. No complex Ingress controllers. Domain and prefix-based routing is built-in.
- **Multi-master clusters** deliver high-availability with multiple control plane nodes. Automatic failover, leader election, and zero-downtime upgrades are built-in.
- **Kubernetes automatically balances traffic and scales your services** up or down based on demand. Enjoy high availability and optimal performance with zero manual intervention.

<br/>

Users have the flexibility to either reserve nodes and deploy on them or deploy first and expand their clusters as necessary using shared nodes.

### **Testing and Release Plan**
The team has already finalized the initial feature set and entered active internal testing. From this testing, they are compiling and resolving issues, which can be found on the project’s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/codescalers/kubecloud). Following this phase, we’ll invite community testers for a controlled pilot before moving towards a public beta release.

<br/>

### **Attracting Users**

Initial utilization will come from the ThreeFold team itself, and the community. Beyond this, we’re also aiming to spark through several collaborations being developed at the moment and outreach. Good audiences for us to target Developers and DevOps engineers who need a fast, reliable way to run Kubernetes Clusters, enterprises seeking production-grade clusters with full control and no vendor lock-in, and AI and data-intensive teams that need access to high-performance next-generation hardware through the grid. We’ll share more as the plan becomes clearer.

<br/>

### **Follow Along**

More to come. In the meantime, follow the progress and support the project by giving it a star on GitHub: [github.com/codescalers/kubecloud](https://github.com/codescalers/kubecloud)
