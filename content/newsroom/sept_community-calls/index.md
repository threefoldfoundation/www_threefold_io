Friends, take a look at the line-up of calls for the month of September.  

<br/>

**Discussion & Demo: Pulumi** <br>
Tuesday Sept 10 @ 19:00 CEST | 13:00 EDT <br>

[Pulumi](https://manual.grid.tf/documentation/system_administrators/pulumi/pulumi_readme.html) is a cloud-native infrastructure as code (IaC) platform that lets you define, deploy, and manage infrastructure using familiar programming languages. It supports various cloud providers, including ThreeFold Grid, bridging development and operations seamlessly.

<br/>

**Tentative: Community Q&A** <br>
Thu Sep 19 @ 17:00 CEST | 11:00 EDT (*Pending enough interest from the community*) <br>

Pending enough interest from the community, we will hold a Q&A / two-way discussion. We will check in ahead of this date to pre-seed questions and discussion topics.

<br/>

**Discussion & Demo: Terraform/Opentofu** <br>
Tuesday Sept 24 @ 19:00 CEST | 13:00 EDT <br>

[Terraform](https://manual.grid.tf/documentation/system_administrators/terraform/terraform_toc.html), an automation tool for infrastructure as code, compatible with major cloud providers. This guide also covers OpenTofu, a fully open-source Terraform fork, compatible with versions up to 1.6.

<br/>

**Additional Notes** <br>
*Weâ€™re reviewing our approach to project update calls, which is why thereâ€™s no scheduled update at the moment.*

<br/>

We are also exploring alternative video platforms and will have updates on this later this week. Stay tuned for more details coming soon.

<br/>

Find the full details [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/july-2024-threefold-community-call-schedule/4380). We look forward to seeing you there!
