At ThreeFold, we’re building a new kind of Internet – one that puts people back in control of their digital lives through privacy, ownership, and decentralization. Today, we're thrilled to share some great news with you: the launch of the [OwnPhone](https://ownphone.net/)!


### **What is the OwnPhone?**

OwnPhone is the first smartphone to realize the 3Phone vision (first announced on 12/12/24), highly secure and designed to work seamlessly with the ThreeFold Grid. It is developed by YourData Network and powered by ThreeFold infrastructure. OwnPhone offers a new way of thinking about digital privacy and ownership. Here’s some of what sets it apart:

<br/>

- **Your data stays yours.** No tracking, no profiling. What’s on your phone belongs to you – period.
- **Built on the decentralized Internet.** OwnPhone uses the global infrastructure developed by ThreeFold to store your data across a distributed network.
- **You’re in control.** Choose where your data lives and who can access it. With OwnPhone, you're in charge of your digital world.
- **Powered by Mycelium networking.** Mycelium is ThreeFold’s advanced overlay network that connects your device securely and directly, using the shortest and most private path – no middlemen, no exposure.

<br/>
