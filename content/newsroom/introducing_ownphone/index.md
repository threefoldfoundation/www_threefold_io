At ThreeFold, we're on a mission to give people control over their digital lives through a more private, secure, and decentralized Internet.

<br/>

Today, we're thrilled to share some great news with you: [OwnPhone](https://ownphone.net/), the first release in the 3Phone family, is being brought to life by our partner [YourData Network](https://yourdata.network/).


### **What is the OwnPhone?**

OwnPhone isn’t just another smartphone. It's a new way of thinking about digital privacy and ownership.

<br/>

Here’s what sets it apart: 

<br/>

- **Your data stays yours.** No tracking, no profiling. What’s on your phone belongs to you—period.
- **Built on the decentralized Internet.** OwnPhone uses the global infrastructure developed by ThreeFold to store your data across a distributed network.
- **You’re in control.** Choose where your data lives and who can access it. With OwnPhone, you're in charge of your digital world.
- **Powered by Mycelium networking.** Mycelium is ThreeFold’s advanced overlay network that connects your device securely and directly, using the shortest and most private path – no middlemen, no exposure.

<br/>

**On the Roadmap:** one-click deployments of chosen applications (e.g. NextCloud) on the ThreeFold Grid via the OwnPhone; Name Services integrated into Mycelium; 3Bot & 3AI; and more.

<br/>
