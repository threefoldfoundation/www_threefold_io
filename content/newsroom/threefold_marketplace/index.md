As we advance toward our mission of delivering a truly-global Internet built for everyone by everyone everywhere, we continue to evolve and refine the ThreeFold experience – making it more simple, more accessible, more cohesive, and more empowering for all who join our journey.

### **What is the ThreeFold Marketplace?**

The ThreeFold Marketplace is an **all-in-one platform that connects providers and users peer-to-peer**, enabling the discovery, exchange, and management of compute resources, applications, and services within the ThreeFold ecosystem. It enables commercial opportunities for participants, allowing them to monetize offerings and engage in business within the ecosystem.

<br/>

The marketplace offers various categories including:

<br/>

**Overview:** Explore the decentralized ecosystem of resources, applications, and services

### **Why it Matters**

The marketplace brings our vision closer to reality. A world where Internet infrastructure and digital services are accessible, fair, secure, and community-powered.

<br/>

By consolidating all ecosystem offerings and the dashboard into a single, easy-to-use platform, the marketplace simplifies how participants engage with ThreeFold. It **lowers the barriers** for anyone to **understand** and **contribute** to the network, making the value and possibilities of decentralized infrastructure more **tangible** and **accessible** – and bringing commercial opportunities for all.

<br/>

The marketplace operates using **TFP (ThreeFold Points)**, a mutual credit system designed to facilitate fair and flexible exchanges within the ecosystem. TFP enables flexible, equitable exchange across the platform – allowing users to **earn, spend, and grow** within the ecosystem.

### **What’s Next**

The team continues to work on both the backend and frontend for the marketplace and **the aim is to launch it this summer**.

<br/>

The marketplace is here to help bring the ThreeFold ecosystem to life, and we want to build it together with you. We will share more in the coming days and weeks, and your ongoing feedback is essential as we move forward. Feel free to share your thoughts, ideas, and questions. We will host a marketplace-focused call and Q&A session soon to answer your questions and to dive deeper into what’s coming. More follow-up sessions will follow, so stay engaged.
