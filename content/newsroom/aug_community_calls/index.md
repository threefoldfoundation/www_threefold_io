Friends, take a look at the line-up of calls for the month of August.  

<br/>

**Discussion & Demo: GPU-Based AI Workloads** <br>

Scott and Mik will demonstrate [GPU-based AI workloads](https://manual.grid.tf/documentation/system_administrators/advanced/ai_ml_workloads/gpu_and_pytorch.html), showing how GPUs improve tasks like image recognition and natural language processing with speed, accuracy, and efficiency. They'll introduce an easy method for using AI on the grid, allowing access to advanced features like image recognition and generation.

<br/>

**Community Discussion: Tentative** <br>
Tuesday Aug 13 @ 17:00 CEST | 11:00 EDT <br>

We will hold a Q&A / two-way discussion. We will check in ahead of this date to pre-seed questions and discussion topics.

<br/>

**Discussion & Demo: Zero OS Hub & Flist** <br>

Scott and Mik will present the [Zero-OS Hub and Flist](https://manual.grid.tf/documentation/developers/flist/flist_hub/zos_hub.html), showing how flists streamline software data management. By installing only essential files on a 3Node, flists enable quick deployment and high reliability. They will demonstrate creating an flist from a Docker image and deploying a micro VM on the TF Grid.
