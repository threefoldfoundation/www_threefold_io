The community has been asking for an easier way to connect workloads on the grid and to get them accessible without wasting IPv4 addresses.

<br/>

In response, the team listened and brought in a solution. In this demo, Mik and Scott showcase how a single public IPv4 gateway VM can unlock powerful deployments on the ThreeFold Grid. By combining IPv4, WireGuard, and Mycelium, the gateway securely connects non-IPv4 VMs without requiring their own public IPs.

<br/>

It’s a smart way to stretch scarce IPv4 resources while still providing grid users with options, including NAT or proxy setups, resiliency through multiple protocols, and overall efficient networking.

<br/>

And it doesn’t stop there; Scott & Mik also highlighted what this could mean going forward, such as Mycelium acting as a Cloudflare alternative with CDN features, running apps like Nextcloud, Jitsi, or experimenting with decentralized databases like Dolt.

<br/>

It’s more than a proof of concept; it is a template for builders to play with, adapt, and improve. It is a starting point to keep pushing toward a more open and resilient Internet, together.
