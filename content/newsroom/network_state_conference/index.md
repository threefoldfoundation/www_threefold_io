Florian presented how ThreeFold's infrastructure supports network states by ensuring autonomy, security, and control over data and governance.

<br/>

“We are building the infrastructure layer for Network State as a Service by combining a decentralized cloud running on bare metal with a digital free zone from where we can all exist freely.”

<br/>

“We built a network layer and platform where any community can deploy directly its own sovereign cloud.”

<br/>
