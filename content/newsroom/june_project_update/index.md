We hosted a general project update this Wednesday covering a range of topics. Kristof started off with a general state of things to set the stage for the coming summer (northern hemisphere) months. Then, Sam reviewed ThreeFold positioning and TF Grid vs TF Grid 4, and Scott detailed the highlights of TF Grid v3.14 (heading to mainnet thanks to a successful DAO vote this week).

<br>

Next, Theo from Project Internet Capacity / Zonaris spoke briefly, and Kristof showed the investor-focused presentation being prepared by the team. Kristof continued with some behind the scenes info about conversations we are having with partners and potential partners and showed some demos, and then covered what’s coming with the next grid release (v3.15).

<br>

Finally, Mik discussed recent documentation updates, and Sam covered on the ground highlights from the past month, before answering a question from the community, and signing off.
