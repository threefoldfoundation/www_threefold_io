Another month brings more ThreeFold demos from Mik and Scott, plus a community discussion!

<br/>

**Thu June 19: ThreeFold Marketplace Discussion** <br/>
Earlier this week, [we announced](https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-threefold-marketplace-discover-exchange-build-the-future-of-the-internet/4604) the ThreeFold Marketplace. Now we'd like to host a call with the community to discuss what was announced already, share a bit further, and get your feedback. *Please leave any feedback or questions you might have already as comments on the above forum post.*

<br/>

**Tue June 24: TF Connect App** <br/>
With the recent 3.17 upgrade, the TF Connect app has introduced some powerful new features, and we’re excited to walk you through them. Join Mik for a live demo session to explore what’s new and how to make the most of the app.

<br/>

*This call was rescheduled from June 17 due to the .tf domain outage.*

<br/>

**Tue July 01: Node Status Bot High Availability Deployment** <br/>
In this demo, Scott will show the latest developments in the Node Status Bot, which provides an example of creating resilient applications on the ThreeFold Grid.

<br/>

All three calls will be held at 7pm CEST / 1pm EDT at this [link](https://bit.ly/tfcommunitycall).
