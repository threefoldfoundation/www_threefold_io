We are lining up a series of demos and community calls this June and July. Here’s what we have so far, and we’ll add / share updates as they come:

<br/>

**New Upcoming Date: TF Connect App** <br/>
With the recent 3.17 upgrade, the TF Connect app has introduced some powerful new features, and we’re excited to walk you through them. Join Mik for a live demo session to explore what’s new and how to make the most of the app.

<br/>

*Note: This call has been postponed from June 24 due to technical issues. A new date will be announced shortly.*

<br/>

**Tue July 01: Node Status Bot High Availability Deployment** <br/>
In this demo, Scott will show the latest developments in the Node Status Bot, which provides an example of creating resilient applications on the ThreeFold Grid.

<br/>

**Wed July 09: ThreeFold Marketplace Discussion** <br/>
[We recently announced](https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-threefold-marketplace-discover-exchange-build-the-future-of-the-internet/4604) the ThreeFold Marketplace. Now we'd like to host a call with the community to discuss what was announced already, share a bit further, and get your feedback. *Please leave any feedback or questions you might have already as comments on the above forum post.*

<br/>

*Note: This call was rescheduled from Thursday June 19.* 

<br/>

All three calls will be held at 7pm CEST / 1pm EDT at this [link](https://bit.ly/tfcommunitycall).
