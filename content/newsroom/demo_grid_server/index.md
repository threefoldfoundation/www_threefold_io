Our next demo & discussion will be held this upcoming Tuesday November 19th at 19:00 CET (13:00 EST) â€“ this time an Introduction to grid_http_server.

<br/>

In this demo, Mik will guide you on how to set up a Docker container running the grid HTTP server. The grid HTTP server provides an API for interacting with the ThreeFold Grid. This can be quite useful when developing dapps on the grid.
