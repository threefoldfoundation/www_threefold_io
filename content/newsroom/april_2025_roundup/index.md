April brought great progress across the ThreeFold ecosystem! ‚ö° We announced the TF Grid 3.17 release and a new exciting partnership with peaq, visited the UAE for Token 2049, made appearances on podcasts, conducted powerful demos of what‚Äôs possible on the grid, and more. Here‚Äôs a look at what moved us forward. 

### **Announced: TF Grid 3.17**

In April, we announced version 3.17 of the grid after successfully bringing version 3.16 to the mainnet. The full 3.17 preview is [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/a-preview-of-tf-grid-3-17/4563) (some details are subject to change) and key highlights are below.

<br/>

#### Mycelium Improvements

<br/>

Work is focused on scaling the network to support large numbers of users üåê and improving the UI/UX of Mycelium clients. While a slew of new features is planned for 3.18+, the current focus is on scalability and user experience.

<br/>

#### Quantum Safe Storage

<br/>

3.17 includes key QSFS updates: code improvements, a Pulumi deployment option, and Grafana integration for basic data visualization. Clear deployment docs are also coming. All of this addresses community feedback for simpler QSFS use.

<br/>

#### Simplifying TF Cloud

<br/>

We‚Äôre streamlining TF Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è and its documentation for a better user experience. Expect a clearer structure, with dedicated paths for users and farmers, and separate guides for basic and advanced features.

<br/>

#### Open WebUI Dashboard Solution

<br/>

Demonstrated in March by the team, grid users will now be able to deploy [Open WebUI via the ThreeFold Dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oq15lxvkts).

<br/>

#### Solana / Stellar Desktop Browser Bridge

<br/>

Building on the Solana bridge from 3.16, version 3.17 adds a browser-based version to improve accessibility and reach.

<br/>

#### Improving ThreeFold Connect

<br/>

Users will soon be able to buy USDC and convert to TFT directly in the app, plus access new V4 farm management tools. TF Connect continues to evolve into a powerful, user-friendly entry point into the ecosystem.

### **We‚Äôre Partnering with peaq!**

Last week, we announced our partnership with peaq. [peaq](https://www.peaq.xyz/) is a layer-1 blockchain powering the machine economy, already with an impressive and extensive ecosystem of DePIN partners. A more inclusive, sustainable, and sovereign machine economy needs a decentralized infrastructure like ThreeFold! With a shared vision to empower people and communities through peer-to-peer technologies ‚Äì and a deep understanding that true progress requires decentralizing ownership of the world‚Äôs critical infrastructure, we‚Äôre excited for what‚Äôs to come.

<br/>

You can find the full announcement [on X](https://x.com/threefold_io/status/1917558741920059651). More details will be unveiled.

### **On the Ground in the UAE**

Co-founders Kristof De Spiegeleer, Adnan Fatayerji, Florian Fournier, and Weynand Kuijpers were on the ground in Dubai last week for several events, headlined by [Token 2049](https://www.dubai.token2049.com/).

<br/>

It was particularly exciting to be with peaq and some of their ecosystem at Machine Economy Day Abu Dhabi, designed to introduce key decision makers in the region to the machine economy and to founders from the peaq ecosystem.

### **Surge Tank Podcast**

ThreeFold's Florian Fournier took part in the DePIN Builders episode of SURGE TANK üéô a podcast by Surgence Labs. He was joined by fellow guests L√©onie, co-founder of Kaisar Network, and Kaizer, head of business development at Aethir. Florian had some strong messages to share, and it was a great conversation overall.

### **GM Podcast**

At ETHDenver 2025 ü¶Ñ Genzio Media sat down with ThreeFold co-founders Florian Fournier and Kristof De Spiegeleer for two compelling conversations about the future of the internet. [Florian shared](https://x.com/i/status/1912955296206434675) a simple, clear vision of how ThreeFold is rebuilding the internet from the ground up. Meanwhile, [Kristof spoke](https://x.com/i/status/1914495473009721731) about ThreeFold‚Äôs bold mission to reclaim the internet‚Äôs roots in openness, creativity, and meaningful human connection.

### **Demo Time: QSFS & Kubernetes**

We had two amazing demos this month. The first one was on QSFS, and the second was on Kubernetes Cluster deployment on the Grid.

<br/>

#### Quantum Safe Filesystem

<br/>

In this demo, Scott showed how to deploy ThreeFold‚Äôs Quantum Safe Filesystem (QSFS) using the new Pulumi-based deployer, introduced in TF Grid 3.17. The release also includes Grafana-based data visualization and improved documentation. While some technical skills are still needed, QSFS is becoming easier to use than ever.

<br/>

Watch the full demo [here](https://youtu.be/Ho4HJh0DtxM).

<br/>

#### Kubernetes Cluster Deployment

<br/>

In this demo, Mik introduced TFGrid-K3s, an open-source project that automates deploying enterprise-grade Kubernetes clusters on the ThreeFold Grid, streamlining everything from infrastructure provisioning to cluster setup.

### **DePIN Summit Reminder**

Please be reminded that this July, we are co-hosting the [DePIN Summit 2025](https://www.depinsummit.xyz/), happening in Mombasa (Kenya) and Zanzibar (Tanzania)! Connect with the team along with industry leaders and global innovators as we explore the future of decentralized infrastructure. It‚Äôs a unique opportunity to be part of a transformative movement ‚Äì don‚Äôt miss it!

### **Other Highlights**

- In a recent write-up by BlockTelegraph, ThreeFold co-founder Florian Fournier emphasized, "while technology can be complex, its true value lies in solving real-world challenges and empowering individuals." Read the full article [here](https://blocktelegraph.io/building-in-web3-top-advice-from-the-experts/). 

- New on the blog: [A Million ThreeFold Nodes](https://threefold.io/blog/a-million-nodes/). A digital world with a million (or millions) of interconnected ThreeFold nodes could change everything for people and our planet. Explore a future where control is decentralized, empowering individuals and communities.

- Based on community feedback, Mik proposed a [Fiat Commercial Dashboard](https://forum.threefold.io/t/fiat-commercial-dashboard-with-co-operators-tf-connect-proposal/4582) to make ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized grid more accessible. He also suggested integrating USDC purchases via credit card as a [TF Connect App Enhancement](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tf-connect-app-enhancement-automated-usdc-to-tft-swap/4564). Please do feel free to share your feedback in the links above. 

- If you had trouble running Docker inside of a ThreeFold VM due to bad performance with the vfs storage driver, then [this guide](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-to-use-docker-in-threefold-vms/4583) is for you.

### **Looking Ahead**

This month, we expect TF Grid 3.17 to go to mainnet, so farmers should keep an eye out for a vote there. We‚Äôll also be sharing details on TF Grid 3.18 and asking for your feedback there. In addition, we‚Äôll be bringing more details on our partnership with peaq. And Scott and Mik will be back with some more demos, soon to be announced. Stay tuned via our [news channel](https://t.me/threefoldnews) for more as it unfolds.
