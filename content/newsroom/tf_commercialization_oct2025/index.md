In case you missed it (unlikely, if you’re reading this post), today’s AWS outage, which took out much of the Internet, is a perfect reminder of why we do what we do – and why a decentralized, more resilient infrastructure like ours is needed.

<br/>

We’re pleased to share that the team continues to make **excellent progress** towards commercialization. The **Kubernetes Cloud** offering will go live this month and [Mycelium](https://network.mycelium.tf/) **Network** is in the process of getting new features, including VPN, DNS, and chat. As shared in [last week’s blog](https://www.threefold.io/blog/3-step-rollout/) , ThreeFold’s **agentic layer** is expected in January 2026, which will also bring forward the long-awaited HERO.

</br>

Several key commercial partners have signed **official offtaker agreements** to utilize ThreeFold capacity starting next year, and more are in the process of signing on. While we can’t share specifics on who each of these offtakers at this time (there will be joint announcements), we will be sharing more information about them including industries and amount of expected capacity reservation in the near future.

</br>

As we’ve previously announced and discussed, the last TFT are being minted this month, and we **will be moving from a rewards model** (proof of capacity) **to a revenue model** (utilization-based). The offtakers will ensure that farmers continue to receive fair value exchange for their contributions to ThreeFold’s decentralized grid.

</br>

This shift to commercialization will bring some shifts for our capacity providers, who will need to, as examples, have confirmed contact info and agree to certain Service Level Agreements. This is essential to ensure a reliable grid.

</br>

We invite you to **read through the** [Grid 4 Economics Ebook](https://threefold.info/economics/) shared earlier this month for more information on how this is all going to work and please [leave your feedback](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tf-grid-4-economics-community-e-book/4647).

<br/>

As some work is still needed to prepare tooling for farmers (hosters) and customers, and further discussion is required on the above-mentioned economics plan, the team has decided to **continue to pay farmers in TFT in the current proof of capacity model** from the ThreeFold treasury **through at least November**.

<br/>

Farmers will be given proper time and tooling to sign on to participate in the next evolution of the grid, and **we anticipate as early as December, ThreeFold will begin to reserve capacity** on behalf of offtakers for testing as they ramp up for production workloads in 2026.

<br/>

So, what to expect in the coming weeks:

<br/>

- Kubernetes Cloud will go live
- New features coming to Mycelium
- Discussions around / finalization of Grid 4 economics
- Tooling for farmers to sign on to the future of ThreeFold
- And more

<br/>

**It is clear – the world needs what has been created and proven by the ThreeFold team and community**. We are both incredibly grateful (for all that has been achieved so far together), and immensely excited for this next chapter.
