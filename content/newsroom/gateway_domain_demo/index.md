In this week's call, Scott and Mik discussed and demoed gateways, specifically gateway domains, a relatively new feature where users can attach a gateway to any generic VM deployment from the dashboard. This feature brings flexibility to the system for those who want to do DIY deployments. Gateway domains allow deployments to run on the grid while remaining accessible from the public Internet. You can watch the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVpxAt14jk).

<br/>

Based on call feedback, we are planning a demo of the WordPress application. We will cover how to deploy it with and without an IPv4 network. This demo is scheduled for the first week of June. You can view other upcoming calls [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/community-call-schedule-for-may-2024/4324).

Is there something you want to see tested on the grid? Let us know, and we‚Äôll be glad to explore it in a subsequent community call demo session.
