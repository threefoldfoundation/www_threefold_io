On Tuesday, Scott and Mik hosted a fantastic discussion and demo on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and large language models. Scott first introduced these topics with definitions and examples, then explained the benefits of running such workloads on decentralized servers. Finally, he introduced/showcased Llama, an open source large language model developed by Meta AI, and demo'd how to deploy and interact with Llama on top of ThreeFold.
