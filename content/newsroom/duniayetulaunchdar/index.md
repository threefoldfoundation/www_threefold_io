Recently we formally announced Dunia Yetu, in collaboration with the ICT Commission of Tanzania and Arthur Brock, the founder of Holochain. 

<br/>

Our plans include coding academies and innovation hubs across Tanzania, and the deployment of sovereign infrastructure on top of which local developers can store, build, and deploy.
