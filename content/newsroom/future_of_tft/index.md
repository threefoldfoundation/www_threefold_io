There is a lot to look forward to as it pertains to our project. If you haven't had a chance, please take a look at our recent team update (https://forum.threefold.io/t/december-22-2023-update-from-the-team/4170) which covers and reinforces some important topics.

<br/>

We have seen some questions and concerns come in about TFT, particularly since it was shared that in 2024 we will see the end of minting of new TFTs.

<br/>

So we are sharing a short update on the future of our token (https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-future-of-tft/4177), which remains the commercial utility and a fundamental component of our project.
