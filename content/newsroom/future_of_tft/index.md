There is a lot to look forward to as it pertains to our project. If you haven't had a chance, please take a look at [our recent team update](https://forum.threefold.io/t/december-22-2023-update-from-the-team/4170) which covers and reinforces some important topics.

<br/>

We have seen some questions and concerns come in about TFT, particularly since it was shared that in 2024 we will see the end of minting of new TFTs.

So we are sharing a short update on [the future of our token](https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-future-of-tft/4177), which remains the commercial utility and a fundamental component of our project.
