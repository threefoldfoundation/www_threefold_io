With TF Grid 3.16 live on mainnet as of last week, we’re pleased to share what’s coming with version 3.17. The full release can be found [here](https://git.ourworld.tf/tfgrid/-/projects/60) (note that some details are subject to change) and highlights are below.

<br/>

We’re also implementing a new release strategy where we’ll work on smaller releases in shorter sprints. This will allow us to stay flexible and nimble as we move forward. The aim is to complete and release this version by the end of April.

<br/>

**Mycelium Improvements**

<br/>

Upcoming work on Mycelium is mostly centered on ensuring the network can scale effectively to support tens and hundreds of thousands of users. Alongside this, the team is working on the UI/UX of the Mycelium clients to enhance usability and accessibility. A slew of new features are planned for Mycelium in 3.18 and beyond – but the team has first decided to focus on foundational elements of scalability and user experience.

<br/>

**Quantum Safe Storage**

<br/>

There are some notable updates to Quantum Safe Storage (QSFS) including improvements to the code and a Pulumi deployment option. In addition, users are now able to visualize the data by connecting a Grafana instance and importing a basic dashboard (a first version, to be improved). 3.17 will bring forward these updates along with clear documentation on how to deploy and operate QSFS. The community has asked for an easy way to QSFS and we’re happy to bring this forward in 3.17!
