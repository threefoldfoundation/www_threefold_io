In this month‚Äôs project update, Kristoff went deeper into what the future holds, and the differentiations between v3 and the upcoming v4, and MikeWW from Green Edge gave a solid introduction to INCA, the continuation of TFT on Solana (most likely). Whereas TFT built the foundations of the project, INCA will enable scale on the grid. Lastly, Mik shared some tech and documentation updates, and Sam covered ecosystem and on-the-ground updates in Zanzibar and Tanzania.
