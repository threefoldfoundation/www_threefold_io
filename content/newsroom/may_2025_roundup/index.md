May was a month of strong developments for the ThreeFold ecosystem üß± bringing a new version of the grid, the first device in the 3Phone family, important DAO proposals, and an exciting demo. Here‚Äôs a quick look at what‚Äôs been happening and what‚Äôs ahead!

### **TF Grid 3.17 is Live on Mainnet!**

In April, we announced TF Grid 3.17 ‚Äì and last week a [proposal](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tf-grid-mainnet-release-3-17/4597) went live to bring it to mainnet, officially approved by the community this Monday. We‚Äôre pleased to share that yesterday, the team successfully completed the mainnet migration! ‚úÖ Here are just a few of the highlights of the release:

<br/>

#### Mycelium

The latest Mycelium release delivered major improvements in routing and overall performance. For example, routes now refresh automatically, peer activity is tracked, and route caching helps avoid duplicate messages. Several fixes also improved network stability and tools like traceroute.

<br/>

#### QSFS

This release includes expanded documentation, an automated deployer using Pulumi, and also some improvements to the Zstor component of QSFS. The changes to Zstor include better metrics reporting and more efficient use of backend storage when rebuilding files.

<br/>

#### ThreeFold Connect

This update brought a new Market feature which allows people to swap USDC for TFT directly within the app. It also fixed duplicated wallets and contacts, improved transactions pagination, and added new signing methods for a smoother user experience. üí°

<br/>

#### Dashboard

The SDK update introduced a Stellar/Solana bridge package and support for multiple SSH keys in deployments. Logged out visitors can now easily explore the apps and services available for decentralized deployment on the grid, which now includes the Open WebUI App , a new addition in this release.

### **OwnPhone: The First Device in the 3Phone Family**

On May 29, 2025, YourData Network launched the [OwnPhone](https://ownphone.net/) ‚Äì the first smartphone to bring the 3Phone vision to life. Powered by ThreeFold infrastructure, the OwnPhone is designed to give users full control over their data and privacy, marking a major leap forward for decentralized mobile technology.

<br/>

As OwnPhone is the first device in the 3Phone family üì±, features like 3Bot and 3AI will be made available as software upgrades as they are released. Until additional devices are released, anyone interested in 3Phone will be directed exclusively towards OwnPhone. If you‚Äôve pre-ordered a 3Phone through ThreeFold, we‚Äôll be in touch by email in the coming days to explain what this means for you. And our website and documentation will be updated soon to make this clear and easy to navigate.

### **Three DAO Votes Passed by the Community**

At the end of May we had three DAO votes üó≥Ô∏è passed by the community, including the 3.17 upgrade to mainnet. We would like to thank the community for your participation. The other two proposals that were passed were:

<br/>

#### Extra TFT Minting

Some time ago, a proposal was approved to adjust the minting code and remove the token allocation previously reserved for the carbon offset initiative. Following the proposal, the allocation was removed and the private keys to the associated wallet were deleted, permanently removing ~14.5 million TFT from circulation.

<br/>

As we near the final phase of Grid V3 and 1 billion TFT minted, a [new proposal](https://forum.threefold.io/t/dao-extra-minting/4596) was made to mint an additional 14.584.422,3237397 TFT, an amount equal to the tokens that are now permanently inaccessible. Around 4 million TFT will be used for May and June farming rewards, with the remainder to be governed by a future DAO proposal.

<br/>

#### April Reminting

Due to incidents in April that impacted uptime tracking and triggered Farmerbot violations, some farmers lost rewards. A [DAO vote](https://forum.threefold.io/t/dao-minting-april/4595) was held to propose removing those periods from April‚Äôs minting calculations and passed.

### **Demo Time: Private Networking with IPv6 and WireGuard**

In this hands-on session, Scott showed how to set up private, peer-to-peer IPv6 networks using WireGuard on the ThreeFold Grid. The demo highlighted WireGuard‚Äôs speed, security, and simplicity, making it an ideal solution for creating modern, decentralized VPNs.

<br/>

Watch üì∫ the full demo [here](https://youtu.be/TlJSmryxRrk?si=tSYeaS9uoQonz_YR).

### **DePIN Summit Reminder**

Happening on July 2nd in Mombasa :kenya: and July 4th and 5th in Zanzibar :tanzania:, DePIN Summit 2025 will bring together global experts and builders to explore how decentralized infrastructure is shaping the future. Hosted by EV3, Share, and ThreeFold, the event will focus on real-world solutions and innovation with a special focus on the global south.

<br/>

With co-founders Kristof De Spiegeleer and Florian Fournier speaking, they'll bring focus to ThreeFold‚Äôs ability to help power this movement.

### **Looking Ahead** 
Stay tuned tomorrow for a special update from the team! In addition, you can expect more information on the next version of the grid, 3.18, in the coming days. And we‚Äôll have two more demos coming for you later in June as well. Stay tuned via our [news channel](https://t.me/threefoldnews) for more as it unfolds. üîÆ
