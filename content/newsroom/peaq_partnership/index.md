"With a shared vision of empowering people and communities through peer-to-peer technologies – and a deep understanding that true progress requires decentralizing ownership of the world’s critical infrastructure – we're thrilled to announce a partnership with peaq and its growing ecosystem," ThreeFold co-founder Florian Fournier.

<br/>

peaq is a layer-1 blockchain powering the machine economy, already with an impressive and extensive ecosystem of DePIN partners. Together, we’ll build a more inclusive, sustainable, scalable, and sovereign machine economy.
